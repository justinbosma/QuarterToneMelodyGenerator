# QuarterToneMelodyGenerator
Note: Has now become an any scale melody generator thanks to the Scale class in supercollider

Quarter tone melody generator uses gaussian distribution to create a feeling of closeness for notes, durations, and amplitudes. Idea for project from this paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274140668_Techniques_for_Generative_Melodies_Inspired_by_Music_Cognition

To run: Compile all functions, synthdefs (unless you want to use your own), and (variables)arrays.  I have a bunch of melody arrays and pbinds set up. For demo purposes run those and see what happens. Each function is commented to give an idea of whats going on.
